        national team as a forward. He also has Spanish citizenship, meaning he
        can play for Spain. Many experts and critics consider Messi as one of
        the greatest football players of all time. Some even say he is the
        greatest player ever. Messi has 6 Ballon d'Or awards, the most of any
        player, and one more than Cristiano Ronaldo. His playing style and
        skills are very similiar to the Argentine legend Diego Maradona because
        of their short height. Ther is much competetion between him and
        Portugese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo because of their similiar skill
        levels.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi was born and raised in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is the third of
          four children of Jorge Messi and his wife Celia Cuccittini. He has two
          brothers named Rodrigo and Matias and two cousins named Maximiliano
          and Emanuel. Messi's grandmother died when he was 11, and after that
          he generally celebrates his goals by pointing up in the sky in tribute
          of his grandmother.
        </p><br>
        <blockquote>
            <q>I think he reached and surpassed the level of Maradona. He does incredible 
                things, at a speed that is insane.

        <h2 style="font-size: 26px; font-family: verdana">Career</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi began football at a young age and his potential was quickly seen
          by Barcelona. He left Newell's Old Boys' youth team in September 2000
          and moved with his family to Europe in February 2001. He officially
          signed with Barcelona in December 2000 on a napkin. They moved to
          Spain because Barcelona offered their help to treat his growth hormone
          deficiency, and Newell's didn't offer any help.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi played his first professional match at 16 years old on 16
          November 2003 against Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with
          Barcelona B. He was promoted to the first team for the 2004-05 season,
          and made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol as a
          substitute. He made his league debut at age 17, and became the
          youngest player to play for Barcelona's first team in an official
          competition. He scored his first professional goal on 1 May 2005
          against Albacete from an assist by Ronaldinho. The goal made him the
          youngest-ever scorer for the club at that time. Barcelona won La Liga
          that season for the first time in 6 years, and won the league for a
          second time in a row along with the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA
          Champions League in 2006.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          His first breakthrough season was in the 2006–07 season; he became a
          first team regular by scoring his first hat-trick of his career in El
          Clásico. On 18 April 2007, he scored a goal similar to Maradona's
          "Goal of the Century" against England in the 1986 World Cup, where
          Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side and
          beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score. Messi's goal was similar to
          this; he received a pass from Xavi on the right side behind
          half-field, and then megged an opponent and 4 others including the
          goalie before finishing off with his right foot inside the penalty
          box. In 2019, Barcelona fans voted it as the best goal in the club's
          history, receiving 45% of votes. After Ronaldinho left the club at the
          end of the 2007-08 season, Messi was handed the number 10 shirt. Maybe
          his most successful season was the 2008–09 season. In this season,
          Messi scored 38 goals, including one in the Champions League final
          against Manchester United that Barcelona won 2–0 as part of their
          treble. In the following 2009–10 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all
          games. That equals to Ronaldo's (Brazilian) record total for
          Barcelona. Messi also won his first Ballon d'Or in December 2009, and
          also won his second a year later. He scored again in the 2011
          Champions League final against their same opponent two years earlier,
          Manchester United. Barcelona won 3-1. Messi won his third Ballon d'Or
          in a row that year.

        </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi was allowed to play for both Spain and Argentina since he had
          dual-nationality, but he decided to play for his home country,
          Argentina. He led the team to the final game of the 2005 U-20 World
          Cup by scoring decisive goals in the knockout stages. Messi scored two
          goals in the final against Nigeria, and Argentina won 2–1. In addition
          to receiving a winner's medal, Messi was also awarded the Golden Shoe
          for most goals scored (6), and Golden Ball for best player.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi played his first game with the senior team on 17 August 2005
          against Hungary. He came on as a substitute. However, he was shown a
          red card two minutes later for hitting an opponent in the face on
          accident while Messi was trying to pull the opponent off from his
          shirt. He was very disappointed by this. Messi scored his first goal
          for Argentina in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. Argentina
          lost the game 3-2. He was selected for the 2006 World Cup by coach
          José Pekerman. In Argentina's second game against Serbia, he became
          their youngest player to play at a World Cup. He also assisted a goal
          scored the last one in the 6–0 victory. That goal made him the
          youngest goalscorer in the 2006 World Cup.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Messi won the 2008 Olympics with Argentina as well, as he assisted
          Ángel Di Maria's goal in the final against Nigeria in Beijing. Messi
          was made captain of the national team in 2011. He scored his first
          hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a 3-1 victory
          against Switzerland in February 2012.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          On 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by
          scoring his 55th goal with a free-kick against the United States in
          the Copa América Centenario. The record was held by Gabriel Batistuta
          with 54 goals.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          On 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties 4-2 in the
          Copa América Centenario final after a 0–0 tie. Messi missed his
          penalty in the penalty shootout. This was Messi's third consecutive
          defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth
          overall. A day after the match, Messi announced his retirement from
          international football. In an emotional interview after the game, he
          said he was very sad that he missed the penalty and also sad that he
          wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals.

          He came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup
          qualifiers. <br />
          After a slow start to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he helped Argentina
          qualify to the next round of the competition by scoring the first goal
          in the 2-1 win over Nigeria.

          Messi has three children with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo. They are
          named Thiago Messi, Mateo Messi and Ciro Messi. Thiago was born on 2
          November 2012, Mateo was born on 11 September 2015 and Ciro was born
          on 10 March 2018. On the bottom of Messi's cleats is the name of his
          first son, Thiago. Messi and Antonella married in June 2017.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          When not playing on the field, Messi finds time to do charity work. He
          started the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007 which helps children in
          at-risk situations. Messi also opened a kids park for children living
          in a hospital in Barcelona.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
          In July 2016 he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to spend 21
          months in prison. Messi was also fined two million Euros. Messi never
          went to prison, and the problem can be solved with probation. He told
          the court he "only played football" and didn't know anything because
          he left his money problems to be dealt with by his father, Jorge
          Messi.
