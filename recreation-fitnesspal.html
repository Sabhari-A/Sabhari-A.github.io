          <b>High-intensity interval training</b> (HIIT) is a popular form of
          exercise that alternates short periods of intense exercise with
          recovery periods. It's especially prevalent among people taking studio
          classes and participating in on-demand workouts, but HIIT can also be
          performed solo at the gym or at home. Because these interval workouts
          burn more calories per minute than <b>steady-state exercises</b> like
          walking, jogging or cycling, they can improve your cardio fitness and
          burn fat in a hurry.

          HIIT is versatile, so it can benefit all kinds of people across a
          range of fitness and experience levels. But with "high-intensity" in
          the name, you don't want to dive in too fast and overdo it.

          "There are so many benefits of HIIT workouts, but they can also be
          pretty intense and stressfull on the body, especially if you're new to
          working out and/or HIIT training," says <b>Joel Freeman</b>, Beachbody
          Super Trainer and the creator of <b>LIIFT4</b>, a program that
          combines HIIT with weight training. He suggests taking it slow and
          easing into the workouts because, regardless of the exercise regimen,
          it's important to find something sustainable and enjoyable. Plus, no
          good comes from getting burned out or injured.

          Beginners can benefit from learning the ropes at in-person classes or
          by taking an online program from a reputable trainer, which helps you
          become more familiar with the format, moves and intensity. Check your
          local area for classes at well-regarded gyms, or search online for
          on-demand programs with plenty of positive reviews.

          “There is a fine line between pushing yourself and pushing it too far,
          so if you’re new to HIIT training, it’s best to have some guidance
          when first starting,” adds Freeman.

        <p>
          High-intensity interval training can be stressful on the body,
          especially if you’re not used to it. Freeman advises beginners to
          space out workouts and limit the number of sessions per week — this
          allows the body to properly recover. “While working hard and training
          your body to adapt and become stronger is the overall goal, you can’t
          and won’t get there without taking care of your body,” he says. “<b
            >Recovery</b
          >
          is just as important as working hard. Recovery will help reduce
          soreness, prevent injury and overtraining, and give your body solid
          time to adjust as you incrementally place more stress on it.”

      <div class="p7">
        <p>
          As you get started, aim for no more than three alternating days of
          HIIT, says Freeman. You can also build in a couple of days of
          cross-training, cardio or light resistance training in between to fill
          out the week, but be sure to give yourself 1–2 rest days each week to
          help your body recover and adapt to the exercise. This also ensures
          you’re primed for each HIIT session, so you can work hard and achieve
          the results you want.

          Below, Freeman shares a simple HIIT workout for inspiration, as well

          Perform the below exercises in 30-second intervals, doing 30 seconds
          of work followed by 30 seconds of rest. Repeat the circuit 4–5 times
          for a 20–25-minute workout that burns calories, burns fat and

          Anything goes here, but Freeman suggests some cardio, cross-training
          or light resistance training to stay active. You could go for a walk,
          ride your bike, or engage in some lower-intensity weightlifting or
          bodyweight exercises.
